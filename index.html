        <p>Hi, I've been thinking about building my personal website for a long time and I am so excited to finally be able to create it even though it's not perfect yet. I grew up in Hangzhou, China and studied German Linguistics and Literature at Beijing Foreign Studies University. I will mainly post my articles and translations, as well as photos and videos from my travels.</p>
